# A note on userscripts

- I had been using Tampermonkey.
- Now I'm using [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).

The former stopped being open source (or maybe it never was; I forget), so it was hard to trust it given the permissions needed to make it work.

# A note on userstyles

- I had been using Stylish.
- Now I'm using [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus).

A similar thing to above happened here. Stylish went rogue when paid a little money and added all kinds of telemetry tracking (i.e. spyware) into itself. Stylus is a fork started at the last known point before the telemetry was added.
